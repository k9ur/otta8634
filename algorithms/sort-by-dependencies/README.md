## sort-by-dependencies

A short algorithm to sort entries in an array where each entry (potentially) has other entries that it must come before or after in the array. This method is different and less efficient than topological sorts, however it also prints a trace of the first infinite loop it finds.

See `example.js`, `example.py`, or `example.c`.
